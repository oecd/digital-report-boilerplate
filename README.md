# OECD Digital Report

This repository hosts the code blocks necessary to create what we call a _Digital Report_. The blocks will work in desktop view and on mobile devices.

Each block is hosted as an independant module inside the `src/modules` directory containing all necessary JavaScript and SCSS files.

In the [Wiki](../../wiki), you'll find all necessary information, both documentation for each block as well as instructions for how to create a new Digital Report page.
