# OECD Digital Report

This repository hosts the code blocks necessary to create what we call a _Digital Report_. The blocks will work in desktop view and on mobile devices.

Each block is hosted as an independant module inside the `src/modules` directory containing all necessary JavaScript and SCSS files.

The following _blocks_ are available:

* [`banner`](../../wiki/banner) - usually the first section containing a huge image that takes up the full width of the screen as well as some titles, messages, hashtags, share options and buttons
* [`blockquote`](../../wiki/blockquote) - a full horizontal section containing a bold and pioneering quote
* [`breadcrumb`](../../wiki/breadcrump) - horizontal list of links indicating the current position
* [`card`](../../wiki/card) - (**TO BE CONFIRMED**) an element that's used inside the `key-facts` block
* [`compare`](../../wiki/compare) - (**TO BE CONFIRMED**) a section containing an iframe that points to Compare Your Country
* [`credits`](../../wiki/credits) - a small section toward the bottom containing information regarding the photo credits
* [`featured-stories`](../../wiki/featured-stories) - a big section with text on left and image on the right-hand side
* [`footer`](../../wiki/footer) - the fat footer section
* [`go-top-btn`](../../wiki/go-top-btn) - the button that appears in the bottom-right corner to allow to go back to the top
